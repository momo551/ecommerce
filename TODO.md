# TODO: Apply Custom Colors to Entire Website

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Update static/css/style.css to add comprehensive CSS rules using custom properties for headings, paragraphs, links, backgrounds, and borders.
- [x] Update templates/base.html to replace Bootstrap color classes (e.g., navbar-dark bg-dark) with custom classes for navbar and footer.
- [x] Add corresponding CSS rules in style.css for the new custom classes in base.html.
- [x] Run Django server to test the website and verify colors are applied site-wide.
- [x] If needed, check other templates for any additional overrides and update accordingly.
